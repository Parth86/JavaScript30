    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    var age = 100;
    var age2 = age;
    age = 50;
    console.log('age: ', age) // 50
    console.log('age2: ', age2)// 100
    //strings, numbers, booleans assignment make copies

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team)

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Henry'

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    console.log(team) //['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Henry']
    console.log(players) //['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Henry']
    //here, updating team array also changes the players array. This is because team is just a reference to the players array, not a copy of it.

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice()
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players)
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team4[3] = 'Matt'
    console.log(team4, players) //['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Matt'] , Â ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Henry']


    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const cap = person; // this is a reference not a copy

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person) // this copies person obj into the empty obj // {name: 'Wes Bos', age: 80}

    const cap3 = Object.assign({height: 30}, person) //{height: 30, name: 'Wes Bos', age: 80}

    //  ...spread
    const cap4 = { ...person} // {name: 'Wes Bos', age: 80}

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
